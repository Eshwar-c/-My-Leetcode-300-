Track the minimum price (buy) seen so far as you iterate through the array.

At each step, calculate potential profit and update maxProfit if it's higher than the previous maximum.


class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxProfit  = 0;
        int buy =prices[0];
        for(int  i =1;i<  prices.length;i++){
            if(prices[i] >  buy){
                int profit  =  prices[i] - buy;
                maxProfit =  Math.max(profit , maxProfit);
            }
            buy =  Math.min(buy , prices[i]);

        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
